# fastapi-cache-crud
 Scalable, minimalist, and efficient CRUD API built on the FastAPI framework.

## Motivation

The project was developed to provide an efficient and scalable solution for API development. 
With the growing demand for high-performance web applications, the need for frameworks that can handle large volumes
of data quickly and reliably is crucial. This API, based on FastAPI, Postgres, and Redis, aims to meet these demands
by providing a robust and user-friendly infrastructure for creating and managing robust backend services. 
With the reliable storage capacity and high performance of Postgres, along with the fast and efficient
caching mechanism of Redis, this API is ideal for projects that require fast response times, 
scalability, and reliability in data handling.
